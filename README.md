# DNA Sequence Error Detection using Pysam

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates DNA sequence error detection using Pysam, focusing on a small E. coli genome dataset.

## Overview

The notebook covers:

1. Dataset Selection and Preparation
2. Prerequisites and Setup
3. Reading BAM Files with Pysam
4. Error Detection Algorithms
5. Analyzing Error Patterns
6. Implementing Quality Control Measures
7. Comparative Analysis

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook environment (e.g., Google Colab)
- Basic understanding of DNA sequencing concepts
- Familiarity with Python programming

## Installation

The notebook includes installation steps for required tools and libraries:

- SRA Toolkit
- BWA
- Samtools
- Python libraries: pysam, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Google Colab).
2. Run the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.
3. The notebook will download a small E. coli dataset and reference genome.
4. Follow the step-by-step process to detect and analyze sequencing errors.

## Output

The notebook generates several visualizations:

- Mismatch types bar plot
- Indel size distribution histogram
- Error rate comparison before and after quality filtering

## Note

This notebook is designed for educational and research purposes, demonstrating DNA sequencing error detection techniques on a small scale.
